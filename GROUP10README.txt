•Firebase - Helped with installation
•In Progress - Limit user button selection per category on Search Options screen (user validation)

Grading Level:
Same grade for all members

Differences:
•MAJOR CHANGE FOR BETA AND FINAL: We prioritized finishing Search, MentorMatch, and Results over Edit Profile, so Edit Profile has been pushed to the 
Final Release. As well, we intended to use Firebase for the Beta and Final Releases, but too many issues arose in order for us to implement
Firebase correctly and on-time. Therefore, we reverted back to Core Data for the Beta Release.
•Edit Mentor Profile - Added username text field
•Edit Mentee Profile - Added username text field
•Settings - Did not include Font Type as a setting option (due to difficulty)
•Search Options - Changed Advice Type buttons to "Academics" and "Career"

Special Instructions:
•Due to the use of Core Data, please delete the app from the Home screen of the simulator after every run of the app. If not, the manually
added ten users be repeatedly added to Core Data.
•While selecting search criteria in Search Options, choose only one option per category since the group will be implementing user validation
code post-Beta Release.
•For your convenience, you can log in to the app using the following information. 
--For a mentor profile
----Username: pn45, Password: longhorn
--For a mentee profile
----Username: ____, Password: ____
--Otherwise, create a mentor and/or mentee profile via the app Registration process.
